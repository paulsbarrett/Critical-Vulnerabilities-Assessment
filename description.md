# Assessment Description:
My assessment found vulnerabilities within the assessed (target) network. Rather than focus on the higher vulnerability ratings, I will be explaining as to the underlying factors resulting in the additional vulnerabilities, and WHY it is so important for management to educate their staff on the importance of these simple factors. The 5 minute report will include research I recently completed in Perth and Sydney (Australia).
